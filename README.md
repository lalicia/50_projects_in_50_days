## The Concept

I treated myself to this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=project) as I really liked the look of the small projects, and I also feel a bit insecure about my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript - so this seemed like a fun way of exposing myself to more of that as well as learning new things.

The course is by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy), with the projects designed by [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17).

As well as making the projects, I wanted to try and 'translate' them into React, as oftentimes when I'm working on projects and find something that's done in vanilla JS, I struggle or can't figure out how to accomplish the same thing in an app.

## The App

This could be considered a simple app in terms of it doesn't really 'do' anything, but some of the projects really take a lot of research and trial and error to implement! So for me, the re-making of the projects is a learning experience. It's nice to have them all collected together, and I think it's a nice little library of components and features that maybe I could use or implement in the future.

## Tech

React, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Font-Awesome, React Intersection Observer, Netlify

## Some Thoughts

This project is obviously ongoing, but so far I'm finding it really useful in that it's making me feel more confident about JavaScript, and challenging in that some of this is really difficult to figure out! A couple of the projects I really struggled to re-make in React, but thankfully found tutorials to help - others, however, have been surprisingly easy to translate over so that's been nice!

I've learnt about [Font-Awesome]() which is great, because this will be so helpful when needing icons in the future. The documentation on their site, however, is problematic as the React code snippets simply don't work - after quite a bit of faffing I managed to stumble onto the right way, but yeah...

I'm also picking up new things in CSS with styling some of the elements, which is always nice :smile:
